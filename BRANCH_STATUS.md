# Branch Update Status

- No Git remotes are configured for this repository. Without a remote, there are no upstream branches to pull the latest changes from.
- The only local branch present is `work`. No other branches exist locally to update.

To pull remote branches, add a remote (for example, `git remote add origin <url>`) and fetch updates.
