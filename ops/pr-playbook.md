# GoldShore PR Playbook (Conflicts, Lockfiles, and Priority)

This playbook defines how to handle:

- Merge conflicts that block PRs
- Giant `pnpm-lock.yaml` conflicts (never solved by hand)
- PR inventory and prioritization
- How/when to let “Jules” automation do the work

---

## 0. Principles

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. **Lockfiles are never hand-edited.**
   If `pnpm-lock.yaml` has conflicts, we delete and regenerate it.

2. **`main` is the source of truth.**
   Conflicted PR branches sync to `origin/main` first, then are fixed.

3. **High-impact files come first.**
   PRs touching infra, workers, or layouts get resolved before copy-only or minor tweaks.

4. **Automate where possible.**

   Use `gh` and (later) Jules bot/Actions to clean branches, not manual gymnastics.

## 1. Quick Triage Flow

When you see a PR with “This branch has conflicts that must be resolved”:

1. **Check what files are involved**
   ```bash
   gh pr view <id> --json files --jq '.files[].path'
   ```
<<<<<<< HEAD

2. If the PR includes `pnpm-lock.yaml` with conflicts → skip manual resolution and go to Section 2.2.
3. If the PR only has source/config files (no lockfile or generated assets) → follow Section 2.3.
4. If PR is obviously obsolete (old branch, pre-refactor layouts, dead worker path) → consider closing it or hard-resetting it to `main`.

## 2. Resolving Merge Conflicts for a PR

### 2.1 Fetch & Checkout the PR

With GitHub CLI (preferred):

```bash
# From repo root
gh pr checkout <id>
```

Without GH CLI:

```bash
git fetch origin pull/<id>/head:pr-<id>
git checkout pr-<id>
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
Make sure `main` is current:
=======
Make sure main is current:
>>>>>>> origin/main

```bash
git fetch origin main
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
---

### 2.2 Special Case: Lockfile Conflicts (`pnpm-lock.yaml`)

If `pnpm-lock.yaml` shows conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`):

**Do NOT open or edit the lockfile manually.**

### 2.2 Special Case: Lockfile Conflicts (pnpm-lock.yaml)

If pnpm-lock.yaml shows conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>):

Do NOT open or edit the lockfile manually.
>>>>>>> origin/main

Instead:

```bash
# On the PR branch
git reset --hard origin/main  # if you want PR to match main exactly

rm -f pnpm-lock.yaml
rm -rf node_modules

pnpm install

git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "Fix: regenerate pnpm-lock.yaml after syncing with main" || true
git push --force-with-lease
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Result:**
*   All lockfile conflicts are gone
*   Lockfile is clean and consistent with `main` + current `package.json`
*   CI can now run properly

If the PR had important code changes you still care about, sync with `main` first using `git rebase origin/main` instead of `reset`, then still delete and regenerate `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

### 2.3 Resolving Conflicts in Source/Config Files

After syncing:

```bash
git rebase origin/main
# or
# git merge origin/main
```

If Git shows conflicts:

<<<<<<< HEAD
1.  List conflicted files:
    ```bash
    git status
    ```

2.  For each conflicted file (excluding lockfiles):
    *   Open the file
    *   Look for:
        ```text
        <<<<<<< HEAD
        ...
        =======
        ...
        >>>>>>> branch-name
        ```
    *   Decide:
        *   Keep current (HEAD, which is `main`)
        *   Keep incoming (PR branch)
        *   Or blend them manually
    *   Remove all conflict markers and ensure the code still makes sense.

3.  Mark conflicts resolved:
    ```bash
    git add <file1> <file2> ...
    ```

4.  Complete the rebase/merge:
    ```bash
    git rebase --continue  # if using rebase
    # or
    # git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts for PR <id>"  # if using merge
    ```

5.  Validate locally:
    ```bash
    pnpm lint || echo "Lint warnings (non-blocking)"
    pnpm build
    ```

6.  Push updates:
    *   Rebase:
        ```bash
        git push --force-with-lease
        ```
    *   Merge:
        ```bash
        git push
        ```

7.  Leave a short PR comment:
    *   Example:
        > Resolved conflicts by syncing with main, regenerating pnpm-lock.yaml, and merging:
        > * apps/admin/…
        > * apps/web/…
        > Lint + build passing locally. CI re-run.

     git push --force-with-lease
     ```
   - Merge:
     ```bash
     git push
     ```
7. Leave a short PR comment:
   - Example:
     ```
     Resolved conflicts by syncing with main, regenerating pnpm-lock.yaml, and merging:
     • apps/admin/…
     • apps/web/…
     Lint + build passing locally. CI re-run.
     ```

## 3. Inventory: Open PRs & Critical Files

Use this when things feel “crowded” or you’re not sure which PR to tackle next.

### 3.1 List Open PRs

```bash
gh pr list --state open --limit 50 \
  --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,mergeable \
  --jq '.[] | {number,title,head: .headRefName,base: .baseRefName,mergeable}'
```

Optional: run per repo if you have multiple (e.g. monorepo vs infra repo).

<<<<<<< HEAD
---
=======
⸻
>>>>>>> origin/main

### 3.2 Identify “Vital” PRs

For each PR, get the touched files:

```bash
gh pr view <id> \
  --json files \
  --jq '.files[].path'
```

Flag PRs that touch:
<<<<<<< HEAD
*   `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
*   `apps/admin/*`
*   `apps/web/*`
*   `apps/api-worker/*`, `apps/gateway/*`, `apps/control-worker/*`
*   `tsconfig.json`, `astro.config.mjs`, `wrangler.toml`
*   `shared packages/*` (`theme`, `ui`, `auth`, `utils`, etc.)

Those are high-impact and should be cleaned/merged before small copy changes.

---

### 3.3 Decide Merge Order

**Recommended priority:**

1.  **Infra / config PRs**
    *   Root `package.json`
    *   `tsconfig.json`
    *   `.github/workflows/*`
    *   `infra/cloudflare/*`
    *   `wrangler.toml` changes
2.  **Workers**
    *   `apps/api-worker`
    *   `apps/gateway`
    *   `apps/control-worker`
3.  **Web/Admin frameworks**
    *   `apps/web/astro.config.mjs`, `apps/admin/astro.config.mjs`
    *   WebLayout, AdminLayout, NavBar, Footer
4.  **Pages and content**
    *   `apps/web/src/pages/*`
    *   `apps/admin/src/pages/*`
5.  **Docs / README / comment-only PRs**

---
=======
- package.json, pnpm-lock.yaml
- apps/admin/*
- apps/web/*
- apps/api-worker/*, apps/gateway/*, apps/control-worker/*
- tsconfig.json, astro.config.mjs, wrangler.toml
- shared packages/* (theme, ui, auth, utils, etc.)

Those are high-impact and should be cleaned/merged before small copy changes.

### 3.3 Decide Merge Order

Recommended priority:
1. Infra / config PRs
   - Root package.json
   - tsconfig.json
   - .github/workflows/*
   - infra/cloudflare/*
   - wrangler.toml changes
2. Workers
   - apps/api-worker
   - apps/gateway
   - apps/control-worker
3. Web/Admin frameworks
   - apps/web/astro.config.mjs, apps/admin/astro.config.mjs
   - WebLayout, AdminLayout, NavBar, Footer
4. Pages and content
   - apps/web/src/pages/*
   - apps/admin/src/pages/*
5. Docs / README / comment-only PRs

## 4. Using Jules (Automation Layer)

As Jules evolves into a hybrid GitHub App + Actions bot, the idea is:
<<<<<<< HEAD

*   **Let Jules handle:**
    *   Lockfile regeneration
    *   Resetting branches against `main`
    *   Deleting dead directories (`apps/goldshore-agent`, old prototypes, etc.)
    *   Re-running CI after fixes
*   **Let you handle:**
    *   Semantic decisions in conflicted source files
    *   “Does this change still match the product?”
    *   Merge order and which PRs to keep/close

Future commands (once wired):
*   `/jules clean` → sync branch to `main`, regenerate lockfile, push fix
*   `/jules status` → summarize conflicts, CI, and required manual steps
*   `/jules diag` → attach logs from failing builds/lint for this PR

Until that’s live, this playbook is the manual version of what Jules will eventually automate.

## 5. Common Scenarios

### Scenario A — PR blocked only by `pnpm-lock.yaml`

1.  Checkout PR branch
2.  Delete lockfile
3.  `pnpm install`
4.  Commit new lockfile
5.  Push (force if rebased)

✅ No manual merge of 200+ lines. Let PNPM do the work.

---

### Scenario B — PR touches `apps/web/src/pages/index.astro` and `apps/admin/src/pages/index.astro`

1.  Sync branch with `main` (`rebase origin/main`)
2.  Resolve conflicts in those `.astro` files manually
3.  Delete/regenerate lockfile if needed
4.  Build: `pnpm build`
5.  Push, then re-run CI

---

### Scenario C — PR is clearly obsolete or colliding with newer architecture

1.  Decide if any code is still valuable
2.  If no:
    *   Close PR with comment:
        > Closing in favor of the latest main structure. Re-open or rebase if needed.
3.  If yes:
    *   Cherry-pick key commits into a fresh branch based on `main`
    *   Open a new clean PR
