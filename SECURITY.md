## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please email us at <security@goldshore.ai> with the details of the issue.

Please include, if possible:
- A description of the vulnerability and its impact.
- The steps needed to reproduce the issue.
- The affected version(s) of the software.

We aim to respond to vulnerability reports within 3 business days. All reports will be reviewed promptly and handled confidentially. We will coordinate with you to address the reported issue before publishing any details, and will notify you of the resolution outcome.

We are committed to resolving validated security vulnerabilities as quickly as possible, and aim to release a fix within 90 days of acknowledgment or as otherwise agreed upon with the reporter. Throughout the process, we will keep you informed of the progress and collaborate with you on coordinated disclosure. We will not disclose details of the vulnerability to the public or third parties until a fix is available and both parties have agreed to the disclosure timeline, in line with industry best practices for coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
