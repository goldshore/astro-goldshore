# API Overview

The GoldShore API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.goldshore.dev/v1
```

## Authentication

Authenticate your requests using the `Authorization` header.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```
