# Gateway Routing

The GoldShore Gateway handles routing for all incoming requests.

## Routing Rules

Routes are defined in the configuration and matched against the incoming request path.

| Path | Service |
|------|---------|
| /api | API Service |
| /auth | Auth Service |
| /docs | Documentation |

## Load Balancing

The gateway automatically load balances requests across available instances.
