# Authentication

GoldShore uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new GoldShore API key at our [developer portal](https://dashboard.goldshore.dev).

Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Basic Auth. Provide your API key as the basic auth username value. You do not need to provide a password.

```bash
curl https://api.goldshore.dev/v1/charges \
  -u sk_test_...:
```
