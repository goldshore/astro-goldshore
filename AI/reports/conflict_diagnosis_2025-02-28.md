# Repository Conflict Diagnosis
**Date:** 2025-02-28
**Agent:** Jules

## Executive Summary
The repository is experiencing widespread merge conflicts because `main` has undergone a **Stabilization Event** (removal of the duplicate `astro-goldshore/` nested monorepo), while active feature branches still contain this legacy structure.

Attempting to merge these branches into `main` (or vice versa) results in:
1.  **Massive Conflicts**: ~4,000+ files (deletion vs modification).
2.  **Unrelated Histories**: Git cannot reconcile the divergent folder structures.

## Impacted Branches
The following branches were identified as containing the legacy `astro-goldshore/` folder and will conflict with `main`:

*   `origin/feat/admin-app-scaffold`
*   `origin/feat/module-f-final-1`
*   `origin/feat/modules-c-d-e-f-1`
*   `origin/feat/modules-c-f`
*   `origin/feat/unified-monorepo-v3-1`
*   `origin/feature/clean-app-layout-1`
*   `origin/fix/build-config`
*   `origin/fix/monorepo-build-pipeline`
*   `origin/jules-module-2-integration`
*   `origin/revert-2-infra-monorepo-foundation`

## Deep Dive: `feat/unified-monorepo-v3-1`
*   **Status**: Critical Conflict / Unrelated History.
*   **Analysis**: This branch attempts to add Cloudflare Vectorize types (`VectorizeIndex`) and other changes *inside* the legacy structure (or unrelated root).
*   **Redundancy**: The `worker-configuration.d.ts` updates in this branch appear to be **already present** in `main`.
*   **Recommendation**: **Close/Abandon**. Do not merge.

## Recommended Remediation
**DO NOT** attempt to resolve conflicts in GitHub UI or via simple `git merge`.

### For Active Work
1.  **Checkout `main`**: Ensure you have the latest clean structure.
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```
2.  **Create a New Branch**:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feat/my-feature-v2
    ```
3.  **Port Changes**: Manually copy *only* the unique source files (e.g., new components, logic) from your old branch to the new structure in `apps/web/`, `apps/admin/`, etc.
    *   *Tip:* Use `git show origin/old-branch:path/to/file > path/to/new-file` to retrieve content.

### For `astro-goldshore` Duplicate
The `main` branch has successfully deleted the nested `astro-goldshore/` directory. **Do not re-introduce it.**

## Agent Actions Taken
1.  Pruned stale remote branches.
2.  Verified `main` is clean and contains the stabilization fixes.
3.  Generated this report.
